# Ml_Predict_Flask_Project

## I made a ml that predicts students' GPA columns: physical, sleep status, study hours, stress, etc. <br/>

**It has 44% accuracy.** <br/>
**If we focus a little more on preprocessing and model, we can get a high accuracy rate.** <br/>

**I tried with models like XGboos, lighytbm, but they did not give good results. The model I used is random forest model.** <br/>

**I learned a lot in this project: the importance of models when creating a ml project.** <br/>

**I learned a lot about integration with Flask api. So did HTML codes.** <br/>
